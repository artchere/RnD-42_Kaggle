# RnD-42
This is an educational competition for the members of the RnD-42 team and all other participants are welcome also.

We think it is quite easy for experienced teams, so please participate personally.

The competition is about solving a binary classification problem over a dataset without a description of its columns.

Train any binary classification model you like on the data from the training dataset and submit the result of the prediction for the test dataset. Please beat the baseline at least and then do your best to improve the ROC AUC score.

### Мой результат на public lb - 0.90755 ROC_AUC.
### Использовал CatBoost и GridSearch.
